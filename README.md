# Cryptanalysis
A tool to perform cryptanalysis

This cryptanalysis project consists of a software implementation of an algorithm that tries to decrypt an L-symbol challenge ciphertext using a plaintext dictionary (containing a number q of English words or plaintexts obtained as a sequence of English words), using only partial knowledge of the encryption algorithm used, no knowledge of any keys involved. Your program's goal is to find the plaintext (as one of the dictionary plaintexts or one sequence of English words from those used for the dictionary) and within a reasonable amount of time.
